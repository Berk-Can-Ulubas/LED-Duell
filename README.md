# LED-Duell

A game where two players compete against each other by pressing a button as fast as they can.
There is a row of LEDs, with only the middle LED turned on at the start. 
By pressing your button, the current LED turns off and the next LED away from you turns on.
The goal is to push the LED to the opponent’s end, which means you have to press your button faster than your opponent.
