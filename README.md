# LED-Duell

A game where two players have to compete agains each other, by pressing a button as fast as that person is able to.
There is a row of LEDs where only the LEDs in the middle is turned on. By pressing the button, our current LED turns off and the next LED away from you will turn on.
The goal is to reach the other side, that is why you have to press your button faster than your Opponent.

LED-Duell will run on a Raspberry Pi pico with micropython.
